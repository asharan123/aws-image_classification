# Bird Classification with TensorFlow on Amazon SageMaker

## Overview
This repository contains the code for training a bird classification model using TensorFlow on Amazon SageMaker. The model is designed to classify images of birds into different species.

## Project Structure
train.py: The main script for training the bird classification model.
awsipynb.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the step-by-step process and execution of the training script.
data/birds.csv: CSV file containing file paths and labels for the training and validation datasets.
Instructions
## Setup Environment:

Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed.
Install necessary Python packages by running: pip install -r requirements.txt.
Training:

Run the train.py script to train the bird classification model. Adjust hyperparameters in the script if needed.
Notebook Execution:

Open and run the awsipynb.ipynb Jupyter Notebook for a detailed walkthrough and execution of the training script.
CSV File Update:

If the birds.csv file is not available locally, it will be downloaded from the specified S3 bucket during script execution.

## Amazon SageMaker Integration
The script is designed to be run on Amazon SageMaker. Ensure your SageMaker environment is properly set up.

Update the entry_point parameter in the TensorFlow estimator in the notebook with the path to your train.py script.

Set the correct S3 bucket and path for the s3_csv_path in the script to download the birds.csv file from S3.
